# ShuttleTracker

Welcome to Coding Club '21 - '22's project page. This year, we are creating an arduino kit nad mobile app to
track the shuttle to town. This repository will continually be updated with progress as we complete steps of
the project.

We plan to kick this into high gear after the ACSL competition has finished. Check back for updates around December!
